**A static blog website that commits posts to github and allows creating/editing posts in the website**

Intention:
- Use HTML, CSS, vanilla JS and few JS libraries to create a static website for blogging. 
- Provide a page that allows me to create new posts and edit existing posts.
- Commit posts directly to GitHub(will have to use GitHub APIs - not sure if this will work). Essentially, use GitHub as storage.
- Not to have any build steps.
